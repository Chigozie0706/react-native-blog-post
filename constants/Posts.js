    title: "Understanding React Native",
    body: "React Native is a powerful framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript. With React Native, you can create truly native apps while maintaining a single codebase for both iOS and Android. This means you can leverage the performance and smooth user experience of native mobile components while still developing in a familiar language like JavaScript. The framework’s component-based architecture allows you to build reusable, encapsulated UI components that speed up development. Moreover, React Native provides hot-reloading, which enables you to see the effects of code changes in real time, further boosting productivity.",
